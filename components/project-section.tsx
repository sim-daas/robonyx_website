			"This project creates an intelligent, autonomous sentry gun system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect, track, and aim at faces or objects in real-time. The system calculates the position of detected targets and sends precise angle commands to a servo-based pan/tilt mechanism, allowing it to aim a laser pointer, nerf gun, or airsoft gun at the target with high accuracy.",

		subtitle: "By: Bind Vinod",
		description:
			"These projects are created using various sensors (like ultrasonic, gyroscope, and infrared) and actuators (motors, servos, and ESCs) commonly used in electronics. Most of the builds are powered by Arduino, a beginner-friendly microcontroller that is easy to program and integrate. Arduino allows quick prototyping with simple coding and wide hardware support. Each project whether a drone, RC plane, robotic car, or smart glass – applies basic principles of electronics, control systems, and automation. Components are connected, coded, and tested to achieve desired functions like movement, obstacle detection, or flight control. These small-scale prototypes provide hands-on learning and build a strong foundation for advanced embedded system projects in the future.",

		title: "Water pollution monitoring IOT boat",
		subtitle: "By: Shourya and Shreyash",
		description:
			"The IoT-based water pollution monitoring boat is a low-cost, mobile system that floats on water and continuously measures key water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids using appropriate sensors. An ESP32 microcontroller is used as the central controller because of its built-in WiFi and processing power, which allows it to collect sensor readings and transmit them in real time to cloud platforms like Blynk, ThingSpeak, or Firebase for storage, visualization, and alerts. The boat is powered by rechargeable Li-ion batteries (optionally supported by solar panels) and uses DC motors with propellers, controlled through a motor driver, for navigation. The electronic components are kept in a waterproof casing while sensors are placed in contact with water for accurate readings. Users can monitor live data through a mobile app or web dashboard, receiving alerts when pollution levels exceed safe limits. The system can be further enhanced with GPS for location tracking, AI for pollution prediction, and autonomous navigation, making it useful for rivers, lakes, industrial wastewater monitoring, and environmental research.",
